Create a skydiving logbook application for Django

This commit is not the full repository.  I hacked the notion of git commits to create a flowing presentation.  By creating aliases in ~/.bashrc, typing "step" or "step-1" would sort of hotswap the running code.  The trick is to work your way through the git commits to update the website so the audience is not overwhelmed and you don't need to live-code.

Live-coding is wonderful in the right context.

I gave this presentation only twice:

1. Once to a python group I used to host and attend called OCPython. (Southern California)
2. To teach interns how to contribute to an internal monolithic powerhouse of Django code.

Yes, we actually log our jumps when we skydive. The industry is ripe for innovation.


Note: This Readme may or may not destroy the elegance of the script.
